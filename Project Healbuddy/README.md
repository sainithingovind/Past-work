## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 📚 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
  Integrate a knowledge base of post-operative care PDFs and discharge summaries using vector embeddings and RAG. This will allow agents to provide context-rich, evidence-based responses tailored to specific procedures.

- 🎯 **Smart Profile Matching**  
  Personalize agent behavior based on surgery type, day of recovery, and patient preferences — using patient metadata in MongoDB.

- 🔍 **Conversation History**  
  Add lightweight session memory or persistent logs to support multi-turn interactions and context continuity.

- 🌐 **Voice Support**  
  Allow patients to interact with agents in thorugh using  Web Speech APIs.

- 📈 **Progress Insights**  
  Generate positive feedback using patient trends (e.g., “You’ve stayed consistent for 3 days!”).
